# FlashView

__FlashView__ is a graphical programming interface for programming autonomous actions into a robot. It was built around our (_Flash3388_) team's robot for _FRC_ 2019 season.

Users may define actions to the robot via the _ui_ project, and then deploy this to the robot. When the robot, which runs the code under _robot_ project, enters autonomous mode it will execute the programmed commands.
